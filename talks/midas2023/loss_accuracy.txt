Losses defined on A(ctions) and O(utcomes)

Actions can range from being very real (treat or not), to more abstract (distributions)

Forecast is information intended to support a choice of action
via a functional or decision rule

 - PI for A = intervals
 - histogram for A = R^k
 - mean, median

Accuracy defined as expected loss
